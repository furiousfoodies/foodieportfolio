# foodieportfolio
Pitch: As a foodie, I want to be able to always have ideas of where I can eat when the opportunity arises (date night, a rare free night, girls night, bachelor party, etc.). I’m tired of defaulting to McDonalds because of decision fatigue every week!  I’m a goal setter, so I want to see visual progress of restaurants I’ve tried. I also want to brag to my friends about all the cool places I’ve been. 

MVP Features Breakdown:
This app contains one user type.

*On-boarding process for a new user. Include their name, city for their first passport, and email (can include other info you feel is needed). 

*Single Passport view: View lists of restaurants in a city they could go to and stamps/punches of restaurants they have been to. (for MVP just scroll down one long page, as a stretch create a book with pages to click and flip through)

*Single restaurant view page:  Within a city passport, allow a user to click in and view restaurant details, mark that they visited the restaurant (which updates the homepage with a stamp or punch), or delete the restaurant from appearing in their passport. 
(For the purpose of build week, choose a single city to build a passport for) 

*Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.

Stretch Goal: Add the ability to add multiple passports, and a homepage to view all of them. Add the ability to add friends so you can compare passports. Add the ability to filter what types of restaurants will appear in a passport. (chain restaurants, non-chain restaurants, Mexican, Italian, etc.)
